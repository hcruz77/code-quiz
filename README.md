# Code Quiz

## Description
This is a basic timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions, built to run in the browser. It has a clean responsive user interface and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.


## Usage
The user will click the "Start Quiz" button, and the timer will begin. Questions will appear and three choices will be presented.  When the user clicks their choice, they will be alerted if their answer is correct or incorrect, losing 5 seconds for incorrect answers. The game ends when the user has either finished answering the questions, or the timer is up. Then the user may enter their initials and save their score.
